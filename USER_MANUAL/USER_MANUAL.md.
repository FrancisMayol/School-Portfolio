PLANZEE:
Planzee is a planning app created by our team to help students stay organized in both their academic and personal lives. 
It tackles common challenges such as keeping track of schedules, managing assignments, and reducing stress caused by poor time management. With student-focused features, 
Planzee makes it easier to stay on top of tasks and succeed in school.

INSTRUCTIONS:
When you open our UI prototype, you’ll first see the login screen. Here, you can choose to log in or sign up, depending on your situation.
After logging in, you’ll be taken to the main home screen. From there, you can easily navigate to your notes, a calendar to manage your tasks, 
and an online platform where you can ask for notes or access notes uploaded by other students. 
You can also customize your profile by clicking your photo in the top left corner of the screen. 
App settings are easily accessible as well, so you can personalize the app to suit your preferences.
